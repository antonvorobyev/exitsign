We follow predefined rules of source code styling. Our choice is ["Google Code Style"](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

You can install preconfigured settings into your IDE configuration. For IntelliJ IDEA download the
[intellij-java-google-style.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
